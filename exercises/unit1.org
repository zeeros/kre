#+TITLE: Unit 1 - Introduction and Concepts

* What is the difference between data, information and knowledge?

These terms are used to describe closely related concepts. This is also the reason why they are often, and sometimes improperly, interchanged.

*Data* itself is a values collection of qualitative or quantitative variables that are measured, collected, reported and analyzed. It may encode some information or knowledge. Data can be raw or unprocessed, adjectives implying that data requires further processing before being used. In its rawest form, data can be seen as a stone dug from a mine: a certain, intentional effort has been made to take it from where it was with the hope to gain something from it.

*Information* is strictly related to the concept of uncertainty: to break uncertainty we need information. To store or transmit it, we use data. Information is extracted from (raw) data as a result of a processing, which may contextualize, categorize, calculate, correct and/or condensate the input data. Compared to raw data, information may be seen as a gemstone that has undergone several processes to increase its value.

*Knowledge* takes information to a higher level of abstraction: the objective here is understanding. If information may describe a context, knowledge aims to extend its uncertainty-breaking power to other contexts. Compared to information, knowledge may be seen as a jewel: its true value is appreciated when used in the right situations.

* Identify data, information and know-what/know-how knowledge

About the following exercises
- Exercises 2 and 3 are grouped together for convenience
- The paragraphs are already splitted into separate sentences for the same reason
- We adopt these conventions: _this is an information_, ~this is a value~ and /this is its meaning/
  + Knowledge :: extracted from the sentence above
  + Know-what :: if the extracted knowledge concerns factual assertions
  + Know-how :: if the extracted knowledge concerns procedures
