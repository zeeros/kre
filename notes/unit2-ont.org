#+TITLE: Ontologies

* Introduction

An *ontology* can be defined as
- An explicit specification of conceptualization
- A body of knowledge describing a domain
And always includes
- A vocabulary of terms
- A specification of their meaning

It defines how concepts are inter-related to
- Compose a collective structure on the domain
- Constrain interpretations of its terms

An ontology may take many forms, but always has a *vocabulary of terms* and a specification of their *meaning*.

Ontologies enable the sharing and reuse of knowledge by
- Capturing it
- Creating a shared understanding, for humans and computers
- Making knowledge computable
- Making meaning explicit, by definition and context

* Elements

- Concepts or classes :: Properties/slots or facets
- Relationships :: To link concepts
  - Taxonomies :: Use of ~is a kind of~ relationships
  - Further structures :: Composed by ~is a part of~, ~belongs to~, etc
- Axioms :: To constrain concepts with disjointness, covering, equivalence, etc
- Individuals :: Instances

* Ontology classes (OWL)

- Named classes :: Class names
- No-named clases :: Complex class expressions
  - Keywords :: some, value, only, min, max, exactly, and, or, not
